1. Please tell us how many months of experience with BigQuery AI each team member has.
- Team Member 1 (Jimmy Choi): Approximately 1 month of intensive, hands-on experience gained 
  directly through this hackathon project.

2. Please tell us how many months of experience with Google Cloud each team member has.
- Team Member 1 (Jimmy Choi): Approximately 3 months. My prior experience includes architecting and 
  developing an AI Agent that integrates with Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and BigQuery.

3. Weâ€™d love to hear from you and your experience in working with the technology during this hackathon, 
   positive or negative. Please provide any feedback on your experience with BigQuery AI.

- Overall, the experience was incredibly powerful. The ability to run embedding generation and generative models 
  like Gemini directly within BigQuery using simple SQL is a game-changer for building AI applications quickly. 
  The integration of VECTOR_SEARCH makes it a truly end-to-end platform for semantic search. 
  Initially, I ran into an authentication issue between Kaggle and GCP when using the add-ons feature in a Kaggle notebook. 
  Removing Kaggle's permissions from my Google account fixed the problem, and development went smoothly after that.

We are incredibly impressed with the capabilities of BigQuery AI and look forward to utilizing it in future projects.
